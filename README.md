# About the EDA Workgroup
This repository was created by the Exploratory Data Analysis Workgroup in the Inventory & Monitoring division.Throughout the fall of 2020, people at different networks are invited to share EDA projects they're working on. While the code and the products are helpful, the thought process, rationale, and decisions will be the focus of this round of EDA calls. 

# IMD_EDA_resources Repository
Use the repository to link to existing exploratory data analysis code created by people at I&M networks. This platform was created for all IMD data managers, -ologists, technicians, and whoever is interested in EDA to ask questions, look at examples from other networks, and share ideas.

# Examples from Networks
 In March-June of 2020, participants in the EDA Workgroup shared early renditions of exploratory data analysis projects they were working on. Here are some of those proejcts and their authors. Please add links to a GitHub repository if you have one.


1. The Mojave Desert Network created a markdown document to automate quality control for their Integrated Uplands protocol. This repository is set to private, please request access from Sarah Wright (wright13) or Nicole Hupp (hupp2it).

# Learning GitHub
The Sci/Data Vizualtion Community of Practice group recently did a how-to meeting on using GitHub. Their [example repository](https://github.com/KateMMiller/demo_repo) is helpful for beginners.You can look at [their slides](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/file/C6F1C26A-4B4E-4866-B05E-494541DE7032?tenantId=0693b5ba-4b18-4d7b-9341-f32f400a5494&fileType=pptx&objectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fdoimspp.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FNPS_IMD_WG_Data_Science_and_Visualization%2FShared%20Documents%2FCommunity%20of%20Practice%2FVersionControlIntro.pptx&baseUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fdoimspp.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FNPS_IMD_WG_Data_Science_and_Visualization&serviceName=teams&threadId=19:278f30e624114373a65d9611498bd4fe@thread.skype&groupId=e4a2e021-b4cf-4cf6-acef-d0978b86c1a0) or, if the link is fixed, you can might be able to watch their demonstration meeting [here](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/873812dd-df4e-4b2b-afd2-9a62d7cfa9e5).
